I'm going to use this repo to create a new GitHub Action ðŸŽ‰

Ideally, this action will:
1) Trigger upon a new PR.
2) Check for a package.json file in the PR.
3) Check to see if there are any new dependencies introduced into the `package.json` file.
4) If yes, alert the user in the PR that a new dependency was introduced.
5) If no, alert the user that no new dependencies were introduced.

That's it!
